		 In the interest of resolving disputes between you and SendSmart in
		the most expedient and cost effective manner, you and SendSmart
		agree that any and all disputes arising in connection with this
		Agreement shall be resolved by binding arbitration.  Arbitration is
		more informal than a lawsuit in court.  Arbitration uses a neutral
		arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, may allow for more limited
		discovery than in court, and can be subject to very limited review
		by courts.  Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that
		a court can award.  Our agreement to arbitrate disputes includes,
		but is not limited to all claims arising out of or relating to any
		aspect of these Terms, whether based in contract, tort, statute,
		fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory, and regardless
		of whether the claims arise during or after the termination of
		these Terms.  </FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana, serif"><FONT SIZE=2><B>You

		 Notwithstanding subsection (</FONT></FONT>A)<FONT FACE="Verdana, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>,
		we both agree that nothing herein shall be deemed to waive,
		preclude, or otherwise limit either of our right to (i) bring an
		individual action in small claims court, (ii) pursue enforcement
		actions through applicable federal, state, or local agencies where
		such actions are available, (iii) seek injunctive relief in a court
		of law, or (iv) to file suit in a court of law to address
		intellectual property infringement claims.  </FONT></FONT>

		A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written
		notice of the dispute to the other, by certified mail or Federal
		Express (signature required), or in the event that we do not have a
		physical address on file for you, by electronic mail (&quot;</FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana, serif"><FONT SIZE=2><B>Notice</B></FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>&quot;).
		 SendSmart's address for Notice is: SendSmart, Inc., </FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana, serif"><FONT SIZE=2><SPAN STYLE="background: #ffff00">P.O.
		Box 4281, Portland, OR 97208</SPAN></FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>.
		The Notice must (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or
		dispute; and (b) set forth the specific relief sought (&quot;</FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana, serif"><FONT SIZE=2><B>Demand</B></FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>&quot;).
		 We agree to use good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly,
		but If we do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after
		the Notice is received, you or SendSmart may commence an
		arbitration proceeding.  During the arbitration, the amount of any
		settlement offer made by you or SendSmart shall not be disclosed to
		the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision
		and award, if any; provided that if our dispute is finally resolved
		through arbitration in your favor, SendSmart shall pay you the
		greater of (i) the amount awarded by the arbitrator, if any, and
		(ii) the greatest amount offered by SendSmart in settlement of the
		dispute prior to the arbitrator’s award.</FONT></FONT></P>

		<FONT FACE="Verdana, serif"><FONT SIZE=2><U>Fees</U></FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana, serif"><FONT SIZE=2>.
		In the event that you commence arbitration in accordance with these
		Terms, SendSmart will reimburse you for your payment of the filing
		fee, unless your claim is for greater than $10,000, in which case
		the payment of any fees shall be decided by the AAA Rules.  Any
		arbitration hearings will take place at a location to be agreed
		upon in San Francisco County, CA, provided that if the claim is for
		$10,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be
		conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the
		arbitrator, through a non-appearance based telephonic hearing, or
		by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules.  If the
		arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the
		relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper
		purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of
		Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all fees will be
		governed by the AAA Rules. In such case, you agree to reimburse
		SendSmart for all monies previously disbursed by it that are
		otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules.  Regardless
		of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator
		shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the
		essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award,
		if any, are based.  The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve
		disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at
		any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party
		made within 14 days of the arbitrator’s ruling on the merits.</FONT></FONT></P>
